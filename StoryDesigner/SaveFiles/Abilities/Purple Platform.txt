line up 2 square holes and you can dash from one, through the other

Pick 3 points in the world where the ground is purple and a triangle will be drawn between them, which then rotates into a circle you can stand on. (Lass interesting, but far easier to implement)

You could even create a replacement shader that takes main_ texture*main_ Color and returns 1 if it is close enough to purple.
