(how 3B1B might teach a boring algebra class)

Uses Cosine Rider to teach Algebra. Has absolutely nothing to do while this is going on (or thinks she doesn’t) and sometimes, actually just leaves for part of class while students are at the terminals. “The game is a better teacher in this area than me, might as well do something of value while it takes over.”

To make school more cohesive, he has to use electronics as an example for most subjects.

Opinion of [Anris]:

She is in charge of the supercomputer and as a result, becomes rather important to the plot. This is also a distraction though as she sometimes ignores teaching math all together to focus on what she finds interesting. That is, programming and 3B1B style problems with little application but infinite facets of interest.
