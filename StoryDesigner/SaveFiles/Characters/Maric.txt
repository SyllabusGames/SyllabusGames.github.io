A student who goes to the protagonist's school who impresses [Disorder Phantom] enough to get access to Anyu through the school's computer.
He learns how to edit the copy of Anyu on the school's computer. He never gets a scanner, but knows the power he now wields.
He establishes himself as an expert with [MAC]'s company and gets contracted along with Mel in trying to take control of mechs back from [Anris].

Since he never actually faces the protagonists, [WM]'s team, or Anris, he never loses. The entire game, while he does very little, he always succeeds and the people asking him for help (a few warlords and [MAC]) have no hope of succeeding without him. This entire game is just setting him up to think he is unstoppable.

?[Disorder Phantom] gives him a book about elemental magic?

He is responsible for the strange changes to the school computer's copy of Anyu. You can find his demo area in the second playthrough.

“You found the smallest success and decided you ruled the world. Enjoy what power you have, but don’t pretend you have power over anyone.”
