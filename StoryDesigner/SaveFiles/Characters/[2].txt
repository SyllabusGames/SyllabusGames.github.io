Overview:
	Once they figure out [WM]'s goal, this becomes his story:
		They realize [WM] is trying to return the world to one controlled by mages, leading to them realizing [Anris] can do the same, and Anyu was the one thing that stopped both of them.
		He decides to stop Anris.
		
		
	Really doesn’t care about school because he already knows what job he wants to have and already knows how to do it, design mech parts. Every attempt to say “this skill is important for building mechs” runs into the valid argument that that kind of work has already been standardised so designers font actually need to know it.
This gets undermined by an interest in radio control devices.
Doesn't really care about school because [] already knows what they want to do with their lifeI keep saying characters need to fight for something, not against something. [2] ends up working towards the end game where everyone can learn magic/electronics through making and playing their own Anyu levels. He starts with this vague goal and as a group, find this means of reaching it.
