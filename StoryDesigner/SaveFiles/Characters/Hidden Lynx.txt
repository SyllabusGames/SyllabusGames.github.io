This is the knock-off illuminati who work to keep the regional wars balanced so they can continue fighting forever. 

 This is kind of a military industrial complex thing, but beyond that, they choose who rules the many regions of the world and can easily change leaders in a short amount of time. With how many people are vying for power, they can pick whoever they want and everyone can be replaced.
[Anris] is a immediate threat to the source of their power. They act quickly, making him a villian on TV the moment he starts working with [G1] and making sure everyone knows the threat he is.
[G2] is ignoring their indirect orders (he doesn't know they exist but he knows his allies will all betray him) when he accepts [Anris]'s application to his army.
[MAC] get cornered into working with [Anris] and into giving him the runic powder he requests. [MAC] Reports everything to [Hidden Lynx] directly, but like everyone else, has no means of actually resisting [Anris]
