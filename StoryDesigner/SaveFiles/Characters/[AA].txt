The one character flaw he has that is directly pointed out in the game comes up when [Anris] tells him to verify the obvious when something is important. He turned down a lot of military jobs before this one because he thought all the people asking him were awful. While most sides in the conflicts were terrible, [AA] never actually checked. He also makes a few mistakes over the course of the game because he assumes the obvious answer is the correct one.
