He has no core philosophy driving his actions. He is a competent general supplied with troops by a proxy of Hidden Lynx instead of fanatic like most other generals. He is there to give Hidden Lynx direct control of the conflict and otherwise, his side has no stake in the war. [G4] himself is there to test his skill as a strategist, seeing [Anris] first as a fool to be humiliated, and after his first direct encounter with him, as a true test of his skill as a general.

Competent general who ends up being [Anris]'s main opponent for a majority of the story. He realizes the threat Anris could be from a morale standpoint (we have a magician on our side) and later learns what a logistical threat he is too.

By the end of the story, he has accepted that he can't beat [Anris] in a real fight and is working to find ways to undermine the alliances he has built, thinking at least one of them must have been critical to his plans.
(should be better than you, but keeps failing to stop Anris)

After [Anris] loses to [AA], [G4] is upset, like someone overturned a puzzle he was working on. He won by default, but with the game over, he has no way of figuring out how to beat [Anris]. "He beat me. He was winning, and now the game's canceled. No time for a comeback. No more strategy, no more planning… I built a siege engine, and now there are no walls left."
