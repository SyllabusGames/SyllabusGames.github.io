He is impressed by Maric so he sends him all of [1]'s notes and shows him how to work with Anyu.

Goal:
	He just wants things to be interesting. His existence could be ended by a power outage, he has no real goals, and doesn't need anything, so this is what he dedicates his life to because there is just noting he cares about.

Arc:
	He slowly realizes he has been doing a lot but hasn't accomplished anything. Anyu has added sectors, the computer has been upgraded, the protagonists have learned a lot, but he hasn't changed at all.
