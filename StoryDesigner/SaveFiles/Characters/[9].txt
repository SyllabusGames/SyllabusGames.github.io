Friend of [5] in the fencing club.
Write her like she is going to be killed off in the end. Player's probably won't believe it, but it should make them think when they are given the option to let her help in the final battle.
(once a character reaches their dreams, they're as good as dead. Also, make her a kind of mentor to [5] in fencing to double down on the "definitely going to die")
