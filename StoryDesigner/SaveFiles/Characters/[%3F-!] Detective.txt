"I don’t care that [Anris] is taking over the world. I care that he can."

"Detective" who follows [Anris]'s actions enough to see he only really has a few spells he just uses is multiple ways.
After (), he finds out that [WM] exists and from there, starts monitoring most of the main characters.

He is the only one who suspects magic might be a teachable skill. Everyone else either knows it is because it is something they have been given or assumes it is something unique to [Anris] and later [WM]. He is mainly here to show the player what the rest of the world knows, as [?-!] desperately searches for details the player already knows.

He is the actual main character. Every scene he is in establishes (then he questioned ___ in his search for magic) then the rest of the scene is establishing his character.

To [Anris]:
You seem to believe you are beyond everyone else.
I am above everyone. That’s the problem.
Maybe you should tell me what your goal is. 
The world will know what I’m doing when it happens. No spoilers from the press. 



[?] witnesses [WM] recruiting his final member. After this, his main goal is getting a card.
The only time he appears in gameplay is when he shows [5] (who he heard about confronting [WM]) a drawing of a card and asks him if he knows anything about them. [5] later admits he didn't hide his surprise at the question very well.

At the end of the game, he confronts [SD] about the card. This is right after [WM]'s group has had their meeting where [UB] tears into [WM] about being aimless and poorly preparing them for the only fight [WM] had focused on. The group having just fallen apart, and [SD] just having given up on magic after [UB] used him as an example for how ill-prepared they were, [?-!] is easily able to convince him to give him the card. (he has the one [Anris] gave to [WM] since he was given it last and [WM] is just holding on to the one he was given when he joined Paradigm's Guard)
