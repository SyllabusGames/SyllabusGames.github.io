Kid who goes to your school.
Has the bullet hell shield
He has a "The Real Legend of Zelda" link's ark where he starts as an incompetent idiot tasked with stopping you.

He deliberately antagonizes you through his computer sector, completely ignoring the structure of the area. After beating him, you pretty much have to do the entire dungeon because he completely ignored it. 

The first time you meet, he explains that he has been tasked with stopping you, has been given the bullet hell shield, and tells you to surrender Anyu to [WM].
He fires the bullet hell shield down a hallway where you just have to reach him to win.
After losing the first time, he blames luck and tries again.
The second time, he activates the shield in an open room, but [2] dashes through the first two waves and kicks it out of his hands before you (playing as [3]) can do anything.
He then goes to [WM] to ask for another tool and is told he has one of the best magic items there is already.
After you meet [CS], [SD] asks her for help, but she knows suggests ways of getting Anyu through strategy rather than outright beating the protagonists. [SD] makes it clear he wants to beat the team with the power [WM] gave him and [CS] admits she knows even less than him about magic.
He actually asks [5] how much he knows about magic, but [5] laughs at him for asking his opponent for help.
He takes part in [CS]'s plan to find Anyu.
When [Anris] reaches him to send him to Anyu, [Anris] asks him to trade the Lemnos Sphere (Lemenal Space generator) for/ “You’re my enemy, I’m not giving you anything!” If you want to fight me, attack… hit me. Not with that shield (knocking it out of his hands) hit me with your own magic. With the elite power given only to seven people in this world. In exchange for that runic device, I will teach you how to use the power Wess has given you. I’m not switching sides. I don’t want your help. I want the guards of paradigm to mean something. Choose whatever side you want, it doesn’t have to be mine, nor the one that invited you in. I run no risk of teaching you too much. There is no chance you will overthrow me. My fear for you is only wasted potential.
I want to get better at this, but not from you. 
 [Anris] tells him the protagonists have some books on magic. [SD] takes issue with just stealing it so [Anris] points out. "You're already trying to take the most important thing any of them own. Besides, they are your opponents. [WM] would want you to steal from them. I'm not saying that is the right thing to do. It's just consistent with you decisions so far." "But it's" "This is an argument between you, and you, so I'm going to leave… actually no, you are. Planet Net. Steal the books, ask for them, accept my help, convince Wess, or continue in ignorance. (Scene ends with [Anris] leaving a ?phone number? On [SD]’s desk)

After the first time they face him, the protagonists treat him like an abridged villian, someone they can just ignore and make jokes at before somehow winning anyway.

Anyu Tool:
	Massive Terraria claymore that is really light. He also still has the shield on his arm and a short chain connects the two so he can swing the sword using his shield for a little more reach.
