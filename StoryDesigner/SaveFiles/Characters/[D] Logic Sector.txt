Uses the duplicating sword

Phantom:
	An important building from his past, fading into reality and forgotten the moment it leaves your view, like the walls in a dream. Every room shifts when you leave it to be replaced with another. This is a funhouse of pure chaos tied together with the themes of [D]’s life. This room is entirely self contained so it can change size, dumping you in giant fields under looming towers in the sky without any of that being visible from outside.
