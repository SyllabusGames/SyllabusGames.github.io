Hates that he was given the most powerful ability in existence just for being the descendant of a mage and that the protagonists gained it through the luck of finding Anyu, but he does admit they earned it after they had it. He doesn’t know what to do with magic and is most frustrated by the fact that he was given something everyone wants and no one can have and he doesn’t even know what to do with it. He has no plans at all. (He believes the 7 mage limit until after the final battle when [WM] ups the limit to 9 for convenience)

Near the end, he faces [Anris] himself out of pure frustration
[FC] "I haven't done a single thing. I failed to stop those kids. I failed to shut down your servers. So I am going to stop you here, with the power [WM] gave me!"
[Anris] No. You're not. You're outclassed and I don’t think you even have a plan.
[FC] [WM] chose me for a reason. He/
[Anris] Likely not a good reason. I have known him a lot longer than you have. Whatever plans he has told you are likely the only plans he has. He didn't choose you for your ability to beat me 1 on 1, I know that much. So why are you here?
[FC] I have to do something, and this is what [WM] told me/
[Anris] My long term plan required me to teach apprentice, but his role doesn't start for a few years. I gave him a purpose, but he chose another one. I won't tell you what since that would undermine what he is trying to do, but my point is, [WM] made you a mage. His goal is stopping me and that's probably it. You can't wait for someone to give you a purpose.
…
[Anris] What have you learned so far?
[FC] The secret to magic.
[Anris] If I asked you what you had written, would you say you knew all the letters? Essays, novels, control, fire, lightening, (demonstrating each), what have you learned? … Anything?

[Anris] You have been granted potential billions have left this world without ever seeing and [WM] has told you to use it for the one thing it can't do.
[Anris] Magic can do anything except beat me. So why is that the only thing you are using it for? Why are you working so hard towards the only goal you can never reach?
[FC] Why are you giving me life advice?
[Anris] [WM] has decided you are important. We will meet again many times because of his choice. I prefer to know interesting people.
