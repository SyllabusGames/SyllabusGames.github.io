[Further’s Guard / Progress’s Guard / Paradigm’s Guard / 7 mages]

Tool: Mace that can draw in 3D. In game, this mace can create octogrids anywhere.
Boss fight 1:
Use the mace to build a work surface to solve a regular puzzle. This should end up looking something like a Minecraft Circuit where just arcing all the wires to the right locations in a semi-confined space is half the challenge.
Boss fight 2:
She uses the mace to continuously draw narrow paths which arc and circle around her in the sky and slowly sink to the ground and melt. The actual fight is balancing actually fighting her, dealing with things she spawns, and climbing the newly spawned paths so you stay high to actually land hits on her.
