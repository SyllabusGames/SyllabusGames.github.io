This is his story.
	He drives research into Anyu.
	He asks "when can we meet again."
	When he can't make it, you don't meet.
	He works on this in his free time.
	He wants to understand Anyu.
	He wants to find  purpose for this technology and constantly mentions new possibilities, some of which he even works through.
	He gives the real reason for stopping Anris (Anris can control Anyu, meaning everything it can do, he can do, including linking to the internet)
	He starts making plans about making the softscape a digital library, or a virtual playground, or prototyping space. He even plans some of the implementation and spread of the technology's implementation and access by regular people.
His arc is that he starts being the person the antagonist thinks they all are, just completing challenges because they are in front of him, giving everything full effort just because it’s there, but he slowly shifts to spend less time on the school projects he thinks are stupid and works on parts of Lyoko he is interested in rather than just what is necessary. This leads to him making some upgrades you didn’t schedule. They are useful but delay what you actually wanted built.<pre id="6" class="textBox" style="width: 1374.94px; line-height: 19px; min-height: 38px;"><br></pre><pre id="6" class="textBox" style="width: 1374.94px; line-height: 19px; min-height: 38px;">He is here for the same reason Anyu was built, just to see what can be done with the technology.

As [4] slowly surpasses him, he shifts to being the expert on magic.

Refers to people by name, then pronouns for the rest of the conversation.

When you have 3 supercomputers left, he leaves. His family leaves the country. This is vaguely caused by soldiers from a specific country moving into this one while retreating from [Anris] but no direct explanation is given. [4] has to take over all his jobs including making upgrades with the exception of scheduling everything which is now done by [2] and centers around stopping [Anris].</pre>
