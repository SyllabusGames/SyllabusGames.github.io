Tool: uses the multi-sword with a bow to fire copies of it. ([A] actually makes fun of [Z] for their ridiculous weapon choice before cutting the bow’s string with a sword beam) [A] ends up taking the sword from him and using it to spam swords at people.

Tool Anyu:
	Same bow but it can compact into just a handle.  

Charges the stained glass dragon with the multi-sword.

He is the only one on [WM]’s team who fully takes things seriously. He is fully committed to stopping you and changing the world. 
He realises [WM] isn’t really taking charge and starts trying to run the team himself and builds a plan, but keeps getting stuck because he doesn’t know hoe to deal with [Anris]. He actually starts working with a general which you find out from [AA]’s meeting with the knock-off illuminatie. 

After they fail to stop you, he is the only one who is really upset about it. Even though he doesn't fully understand why they need to stop you, he is upset by the teams failure to win or seemingly accomplish anything at all.
