	Once they figure out [WM]'s goal, this becomes her story:
		They realize [WM] is trying to return the world to one controlled by mages, leading to them realizing [Anris] can do the same, and Anyu was the one thing that stopped both of them.
		She decides to stop Anris.
		She puts the same effort into figuring out how to stop Anris and preempt [WM] [1] had been putting into developing Anyu
		She starts looking into Anris's military holdings and even asks some teachers about it in a transition scene from an on the ground encounter to the teacher's narration
