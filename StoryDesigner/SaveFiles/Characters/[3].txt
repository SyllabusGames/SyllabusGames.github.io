Write her like OoT Link. A persona and character defined by her actions but without enough detail to force her to be a real person. (Saber. A person made more of ideals and circumstances than by )
She is basically the default player character, constantly looking to the next challenge with full confidence she can succeed until something changes and it feels like the writers/[WM]'s team, may interfere, at which point she loses a lot of confidence and defers to other characters constantly. Her approach to most situations is just knowing she will succeed eventually (an approach which made most of my life much less stressfull).

When [2] invites her to the Anyu lab, she is a little thrown off, like she didn’t think [2] would remember she existed. When she gets to the lab, she keeps asking if they need help with anything because she is always just invited to things for a purpose.  She was actually invited just to hang out and give [1] some company other than [2] while he worked on Anyu. 

Gameplay: (movement) [Plays like a better 4 Ways Up]

For about half the game, she is just there to hang out with friends. Just keep it that straightforward until the plot gets serious. Then they are here for the same reason everyone else decided to continue opposing the antagonist.

She has a habit of meta-gaming conversations “I haven’t heard much of this conversation, but what lap is it on?” (implying the conversation is going in circles)

Does a little jump before running like I sometimes do.
